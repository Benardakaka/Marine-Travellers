    <div class="container" style="font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 15px;">

      <p style="color: black;">Our customers come from all sectors of the marine industry such as cruise, private yacht,
        commercial, contractors, vessel managers, surveyors, and offshore oil rig workers travelling from their homes to
        their vessels and back again. The success of this business model has allowed us to expand globally.

        Global Marine Travel works directly with individuals as well as cruise lines and marine industry companies who
        engage GMT by contract for both one-off, dry-dock, new-build or regular crew rotations. To meet the
        ever-changing needs of our clients, we offer a full portfolio of services such as hotel, visa services, car
        rentals, crew transfers, rail, helicopters, charters, and all low-cost air carriers. Our agents are on duty 24
        hours per day 7 days per week year round.

      </p>

      <p style="color: black;">Marine transportation also encompasses passenger transportation, military and defense,
        fishing or marine resource applications, and maritime support such as navigation or
        vessel maintenance. All of these applications contribute to the overall environmental impact of marine
        transportation,
        though not as significantly as trade dominates the sector (Walker et al., 2019).</p>
